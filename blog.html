						<h3 class="title">A Fruitful 2016</h3>
						<p> It has been an insightful experience interning as a product developer under Commercial Mobility (CM). I have been exposed to the ups and downs of being in an internal start up within a larger firm. If I would describe this experience in two words, it would be unpredictable and empowering. Adora Cheung, cofounder and CEO of Homejoy’s definition of a start-up resonated strongly with me: “Startup is a state of mind. It’s when people join your company and are still making the explicit decision to forgo stability in exchange for the promise of tremendous growth and the excitement of making immediate impact.” There is much potential for disruption in the commercial mobility space and it is exciting to be at the center of how CM executes its go-to-market strategy for its products and services. It gives me privilege access into heart of how CM is changing the game for HP as a whole. The launch of the Elite x3, where pundits have called it a “game-changer” for HP in the enterprise mobility space, was planned and its strategy executed in the same building that I worked in. </p><br>

        				<h3 class="title">On Scaling</h3>
    					<p>Although CM is a new business unit in HP, it is expected to scale quickly. There is tremendous pressure on the organization to be successful in making breakthroughs in the mobility space. As a result, CM has to make decisions that would ensure that the business unit grows in revenue, sometimes making tough calls to axe certain projects or even teams if it did not contribute enough to CM’s bottom line.</p>

						<h3 class="title">On Communication and Culture</h3>
						<p>Though being in CM is unpredictable, Michael keeps all major business decisions and activity transparent. We were treated like full time staff and we were allowed to attend and contribute to employee meetings. These meetings help us to better comprehend the situation of the company at the given time and understand how our roles in fulfill the larger picture. Meetings were held on a regular basis (once a month, depending on necessity) and we could clarify any doubts to Michael himself.</p> <br>
						<p>Despite CM trying to behave like a start-up, it still has to deal with the bureaucracies of a large organization. This means that there is a standard operating procedure for everything and there are protocols to follow. While having these procedures are useful in ensuring checks and balances within such a massive organization, it greatly hinders innovative thinking as people are always afraid of making a decision. Michael is fully aware of this problem and believes in empowering his employees to make decisions. He ensures that we have a flat hierarchy, and we as employees, regardless of rank, can voice out our opinions or provide suggestions for improvement.</p><br>
						
						<h3 class="title">On Product Development</h3>
						<p>I have had the opportunity to work with some of the most driven people I have ever met and we were given autonomy to build software applications for CM. Our team operated in an agile manner and was given free reign to design and implement our ideas into CM’s projects for us. This was an empowering experience as my superiors were very supportive of our team’s endeavors.</p>
					
						<br>
						<h3 class="title">What's Next?</h3>
						<p>Looking back I feel extremely blessed to have this opportunity to work here in the Bay Area. The work is challenging, the people are driven to suceed and the possibilities of success is endless. You're only limited by your imagination. Who knows, I may end up back there after graduation. We'll see.</p><br><br>
